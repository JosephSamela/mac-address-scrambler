# mac-address-scrambler
Quickly scramble you mac address -- seriously it only takes a second.

## Story Time
Be me. <br />
Go on vacation to New Zealand. <br />
Have fun time. <br />
Arrive at Aukland airport for flight home. <br />
Take out laptop. Use free airport wifi. <br />
"Free" wifi expires after 45mins. Need to pay $$ for more. <br />
insert -->"wft.jpg"<-- <br />
How does wifi know my time limit is expired? <br />
Open terminal. <br />
Ugh, BASH. What's the command again? <br />
Finally change MAC address. <br />
Reconnect to wifi...and another 45min! <br />
Need to make process faster. <br />
Put commands into bash script. <br />
When time limit is up, run bash script, reconnect to wifi. <br />

## How to use
Download the script.
Open terminal.
cd to script location.
Enter --> "bash mac-scrambler"

Computer has new randomized mac address. Good job.
