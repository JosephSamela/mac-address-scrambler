# mac-address-scrambler
Quickly scramble you mac address -- seriously it only takes a second.

## Story Time
Be me. <br />
Go on vacation to New Zealand. <br />
Have fun time. <br />
Arrive at Aukland airport for flight home. <br />
Take out laptop. Use free airport wifi. <br />
"Free" wifi expires after 45mins. Need to pay $$ for more. <br />

How does wifi know my time limit is expired? <br />
Try with new email address --> "burrito@quesadilla.taco" <br />
Didn't work, must be hardware address.
Open terminal. <br />
Ugh, BASH. What's the command again? <br />
Change MAC address. <br />
Reconnecting...and 45min more of free wifi! <br />
But typing those commands is a pain. Gotta make faster. <br />
Put commands into bash script. <br />
When time limit is up, run bash script again, reconnect to wifi. <br />
Unlimited free wifi achieved! <br />

Download the script. <br />
Open terminal. <br />
cd to script location. <br />

Computer has new randomized mac address. Good job.
