# mac-address-scrambler
Quickly scramble you mac address -- seriously it only takes a second.

## The Story
Be me.
Go on vacation to New Zealand.
Have fun time.
Arrive at Aukland airport for flight home.
Take out laptop. Use free airport wifi.
"Free" wifi expires after 45mins. Need to pay $$ for more.
insert -->"wft.jpg"<--
How does wifi know my time limit is expired?
Open terminal.
Ugh, BASH. What's the command again?
Finally change MAC address.
Reconnect to wifi...and another 45min!
Need to make process faster. 
Put commands into bash script.

## How to use
Run script. Computer has new randomized mac address.
